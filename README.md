# AUTOMATIC-ROOM-TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLER-USING-ARDUINO

The “Automatic room temperature control and
monitoring system using Arduino”.
In this process the room temperature is maintained
constantly. In which the value is set by the user the
heater and Ac turned on or off. The system will
always get the temperature from the DHT11
temperature sensor. The DHT11 temperature sensor
measures both the temperature and humidity of the
room. The value of temperature and humidity is
displayed in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The entire
system was controlled by the Arduino Microcontroller.
The Microcontroller senses the temperature and it
compares the data value set by the user. The
controller turns on the AC when the current
temperature is higher than the required data
temperature and the controller turns on the heater
when the current temperature is lower than the
reqquired temperature.
